# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview

**Tic Tac Toe** is a simple two-player game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking a grid with either "X" or "O". The first player to get three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. This project is a basic implementation of the popular game, showcasing the use of JavaScript for interactivity and game logic.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode**: Players take turns clicking on the grid to place "X" or "O".
- **Game Winning Conditions**: The game detects when a player has won by forming three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
- **Restart Game**: A button to restart the game after it ends, allowing players to play again.
- **Draw Detection**: If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
- **Responsive Design**: The game interface adjusts for different screen sizes, ensuring it works well on mobile and desktop devices.

## Technologies Used
